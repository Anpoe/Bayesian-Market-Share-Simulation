# Bayesian-Market-Share-Simulation

This repository contains an R script for simulating market shares based on the multinomial logit model using Bayesian hierarchical model estimation. It includes a function for market share simulation, estimation of the logit model, and profit calculation for different prices. The script also provides a visual representation of the relationship between price and profit.
